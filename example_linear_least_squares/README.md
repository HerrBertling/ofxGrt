##Linear Least Squares Example

This example demonstrates the how to use GRT Linear Least Squares algorithms.  

The example will generate a basic linear dataset (using a linear trend plus some random noise) and fit a straight line to this dataset using the LinearLeastSquares algorithm.

The image below shows the random data points (in blue) and the estimated line fit to the dataset (in red).
